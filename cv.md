## Summary
My experience in marketing is 6 years. I studied it from the business side and from the client side. One day I had the opportunity to create a website. I wanted to learn more about creating websites and therefore did not contact the developer, but decided to make website myself. Since the site needed a static one, I made it on CMS Tilda - very convenient and focused on increasing the conversion of the site.

After 6 months, the site that I made began to bring 10-15 times more applications compared to the old site.

Then I was offered to create an online store. I did it already with the help of the command. Coordinated their work, helped with writing the code and linking the CRM system, payment system, delivery method, actual unloading of goods, etc.

During this time, I continued to develop in marketing and realized that I really like creating websites. And I decided to thoroughly study Front-end development.

Now I am a novice Front-end developer with a lot of knowledge in marketing.

I will be very happy to help you create an incredible website that will bring you prot and satisfaction to users.
